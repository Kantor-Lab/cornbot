          This pipeline is meant as a plug-and-play system, meaning it can be applied to varying similar agricultural
          problems with few necessary changes.
          Each step described below could be swapped out for alternatives based on the specific task at hand: we've
          implemented some of these alternatives already.<br><br>

          The stalk detection is packaged as a ROS node, which registers a ROS <a
            href="http://wiki.ros.org/Services">service</a> (allowing a request-reply communication between two nodes),
          which takes as parameters a number of images to process and a timeout, and returns the final stalk
          information.<br><br>

          Installation instructions and more usage documentation can be found in the code:

          Video data was collected in multiple regions of a corn field from a mobile phone, capturing diverse lighting,
          weather conditions, viewpoints, and plant age. The phone was positioned low to the ground to mimic the
          approximate viewpoint of the camera on the manipulator. One frame each second was then extracted from the
          videos, and extraneous images were removed.</p>
        <p>

          The remaining 2667 images were labeled using a tool which uses Meta's Segment Anything model. Masks were drawn
          for all stalks in the foreground, extending from the bottom of the visible stalk to the first occlusion by the
          plant's leaves (which, for our purposes, marks the approximate top of the stalk). This produced 7681 stalk
          instance annotations. The images were then split randomly into 80% training, 10% validation, and 10% testing
          data.

            href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03144">Feature Pyramid Networks</a> for segmentation. Using Detectron2's
          benchmark model for this architecture, Mask-R-CNN was fine-tuned on our training data for 40000 iterations,
          with a maximum learning rate of 0.00025 and the "WarmupMultiStepLR" scheduler, and a batch size of 4. Training
          took 6.7 hours on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080. Our trained model can be found here (TODO).

          <p>
            We treat stalks as 3D lines extending from some point on the ground to some point in spaceâ€”this simplified
            model is a tradeoff between 3D accuracy and computational complexity. Let's take a look at how a single
            frame is processed (a frame has a color and depth image):
          </p>

          <p>
            First, our segmentation model produces masks for the color image. The masks are then partitioned into
            vertical <i>slices</i> (we found 10 pixels to be a sufficient vertical distance between slices to balance
            performance and accuracy, but this hyper-parameter can be adjusted to account for varying stalk height). We
            call the centerpoint of each slice its <i>feature point</i>. In each slice, the median depth measurement
            among all points is extracted from the depth image and assigned to the slice's feature point.<br><br>

            The 3D feature points are then transformed to the robot's base frame. RANSAC line fitting and Least Squares
            for refinement are then run on the feature points of each stalk to get lines, which are then extended to the
            world's ground plane. The grasping point of the stalk is simply the point along this line at the specified Z
            height (a hyper-parameter) above the ground.

        <h3 class="title is-4">Best Stalk Determination</h2>

          <p>
            We've now produced a number of 3D grasping points for each frame, so we need to decide which stalk is best
            to grasp: <br><br>

            Based on the manipulator dimensions and shape, stalks which are not graspableâ€”those where another stalk is
            blocking the predicted path the manipulator would take to insert the sensor, or where the manipulator
            would not be able to reachâ€”are eliminated. Stalks with unrealistic positions, caused by sporadic
            segmentation output, misalignment between the depth map and image, or mis-measurements in the depth map,
            are eliminated as well. The best stalk is then determined from among those remaining based on a heuristic
            weighting function using the stalk's height and width, the confidence of the segmentation model's
            prediction, and the distance of the stalk from the optimal grasping position for the arm. This weighting
            function favors stalks which are more easily graspable and which have a higher chance for successful
            insertion; the precise weighting of these factors could be adjusted for a different task based on the most
            favorable conditions for the manipulator.
          </p>

          <h3 class="title is-4">Consensus Among Frames</h2>

            <p>
              This process is repeated for a number of frames, after which the best stalks from all frames are
              clustered and the largest cluster is taken to be the consensus stalk. A representative stalk from this
              cluster is then chosen, and the grasping point for this stalk is determined to be the final grasping
              point.<br><br>

              If no valid stalks are detected among any frameâ€”which may occur if there are no stalks in view, or if
              the stalks are too difficult to processâ€”a <i>reposition</i> response is given, indicating to the robot
              that the current viewpoint is insufficient to estimate a reasonable insertion pose.
